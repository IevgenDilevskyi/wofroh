# WoFroH

Trying to stay fit is an endeavor that is probably on your mind, but lets face
it, it's easier said than done. There always seems to be something getting in the way. Maybe the sports team you're a part of cancelled their next game, or you can't go to the gym for some reason or another, and you would like to workout at home but you don't know what to do?

If that has been you at any point in time, this app is for you. Our team designed this app to people like you and me. To stay fit, no matter where they are, what little equipment we have, and using any device.

With WoFroH, all you need to do is figure out what your goal is and it does the heavy lifting for you.

## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.

If this doesn't work, please message me!
